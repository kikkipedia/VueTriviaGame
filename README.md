## Authors [kikkipedia] (https://github.com/kikkipedia) and [Daniel Dumville](https://github.com/Dandandumdum) :handshake:

### This project was structured around the specifications outlined by Noroff which are summarised below:

-	Build an online trivia game as a Single Page Application using the Vue.js framework (version 2.x).
-	Design a wireframe using Figma
-	Write HTML % CSS as needed

##### Start Screen
- App starts here
- User must be able to select the difficulty, number of questions and category. 
- User must click a button or anywhere on the screen to start playing.

##### The Question Screen
- Once the game starts, the app must fetch the questions from the API setup in the previous step. The app must ONLY display ONE question at a time. 
- If it is multiple choice, have 4 buttons with each answer as the text. If it is a True/False question, only display 2 buttons, one for True and one for False.
- Once a question is answered the app must move on to the next question. 
- When all the questions have been answered the user must be presented with the result screen.

##### The Result Screen
- The result screen must show all the questions along with the correct and userâ€™s answers.
- Display the total score. 
- Display a button to take the user back to the start screen or replay with different questions, but at the current difficulty level and category.
